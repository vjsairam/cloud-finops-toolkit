Purpose

Enterprise-grade, multi-cloud FinOps automation that turns raw cloud billing + usage into actionable guardrails: anomaly detection, budget enforcement, unit-economics dashboards, and automated remediations—wired into engineering workflows (Slack/Jira/git).

Outcomes (Executive)

15–30% cloud cost reduction without SLO regressions.

Per-team/unit cost visibility (service, environment, tenant).

“Detect → Decide → Act” loop in < 15 minutes for anomalies.

Scope
Features

Ingestion layer: Pull AWS CUR/Cost Explorer + GCP BigQuery Billing + Azure Cost Management (daily), normalize to a common schema (FOCUS-like), enrich with tags (service/env/team) + OpenCost for K8s allocation.

Allocation & Unit Economics: Blend infra cost (nodes, storage, egress) with application dimensions (requests, tokens, tenants) to compute cost per request/model/feature.

Anomaly Detection: Baseline + seasonality + change-point (e.g., Twitter’s Anomalous, Prophet, or Ruptures) with severity scores; route to Slack/Jira with playbooks.

Budgets & Policies: Budget objects (monthly/quarterly) with burn-rate alerts; policy-as-code (OPA/Rego) to gate deployments on budget or tag hygiene.

Automated Remediations: Safe actions (scale-down non-prod at night, delete unattached EBS/IPs, rightsize underutilized RDS/OpenSearch); dry-run + approval gates.

Dashboards: Grafana: Cost by team/service/env, anomaly heatmap, cost/SLO correlation, savings realized (tracked against RFCs).

Governance: Tag policy auditor + PR bot to enforce tagging in IaC; exception registry.

Non-Functional

Accuracy: ±3% vs provider bills.

Latency: New billing data visible < 2h from provider export.

Security: Read-only, least privilege; PII-free; signed images & SBOM.

Operability: RTO ≤ 2h; SLO 99.9% for APIs/dashboards.

Architecture

Data plane: ETL (Python) → Warehouse (Athena/BigQuery or DuckDB for OSS) → Allocation jobs (dbt or SQL) → APIs (FastAPI) → Webhooks (Slack/Jira).

Control plane: OPA/Rego for policy checks; GitHub Action for pre-deploy budget/tag checks; Scheduler (Airflow/Cloud Composer/GHA cron).

K8s: Optional: Deploy ETL + API on EKS/GKE; OpenCost sidecar for cluster allocation.

Deliverables

/ingestion module (cloud connectors, schema normalizer)

/allocation (SQL/dbt models + tests)

/anomaly (lib + thresholds + drift dashboards)

/policies (Rego policies + CI check)

/actions (remediation playbooks + dry-run)

dashboards/ (Grafana JSON)

docs/ (runbook, data dictionary, governance model)

Acceptance Tests

Reconcile sample month within ±3%.

Trigger synthetic 25% spike → alert in Slack <15 min.

Block a PR that violates tag/budget policy.

Dry-run remediation generates a change plan; approval executes.

Roadmap (8–10 weeks)

W1–2: Ingestion + schema + initial dashboards.

W3–4: Allocation joins (OpenCost) + unit economics.

W5–6: Anomaly detection + Slack/Jira pipeline.

W7: Policies (OPA) + CI gate; sample remediations (nightly scale-down).

W8–9: Hardening (SBOM, Cosign), runbook, performance, docs.

W10: Case study: 2 real savings RFCs + measured impact.

Resume Bullets (copy)

Built a multi-cloud FinOps platform with policy-as-code and automated remediations, delivering 18% cost reduction with zero SLO regressions.

Implemented unit-economics (service/tenant/request) by blending CUR + OpenCost, enabling budget-gated deployments via OPA.
