## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Don't skip testing** - Write tests as you go, not at the end
2. **Start with MVP** - Don't try to build everything at once
3. **Document decisions** - Use ADRs for architecture choices
4. **Measure everything** - Add metrics from day one
5. **Security first** - Never commit secrets, always use env vars
6. **Ask for reviews** - Even simulated reviews help catch issues
7. **Keep it simple** - YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
8. **Showcase early** - Start documenting wins from week 1
